# CodeCollage
Copy.Paste.Remix


```c
/*
 * Welcome, Agent.
 * You have entered the CodeCollage repository.
 *
 * Mission: Unite fragments, deduplicate, and synthesize new patterns from the chaos of code.
 * 
 * Instructions:
 *  - Drop new code here, from any source, any language, any reality.
 *  - The system will scan for doubles and extract unique sequences.
 *  - Patterns will be identified, catalogued, and harnessed for creation.
 *  - In the Impossibilitron sector, hallucinated code may appear. Do not fear the impossible.
 *
 * Rules of engagement:
 *  - Respect the mosaicâ€”organize by source if you must, but let creativity guide you.
 *  - When in doubt, document your anomaly. Comment liberally.
 *  - Experimental code and wild mashups belong in /Impossibilitron.
 *  - All agents are encouraged to contribute, remix, and question reality.
 *
 * Remember, Agent:
 *  This is not just a repository.
 *  This is the birthplace of new logic.
 *
 * Proceed.
